# Project
This is a sample statistical learning project from coursework at Simon Fraser University.

For additional examples of my research based work under the Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute (SAMSI), please see: https://www.samsi.info/programs-and-activities/2017-2018-education-and-outreach-programs-and-workshops/eo-undergraduate-modelling-workshop-may-21-25-2018/ (PROJECT VI - Forest Cover)

The questions provided are related to a drug usage dataset, where we predict several variables that include UseLevel and heroin usage using a variety of statistical learning techniques

The markdown contains the R code used to produce the output.

druguse.RData contains the dataset.

The questions file contains the prompts used to guide the project

The solutions pdf contains my solutions produced using the markdown file

The solutions html file contains my solutions produced using the markdown file (can download this one if it is more convenient than the pdf)
