# Project
This is a sample project from coursework at Simon Fraser University.  The project’s focus in on supervised learning and the construction of several binary classifiers.

For additional examples of my research based work under the Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute (SAMSI), please see: https://www.samsi.info/programs-and-activities/2017-2018-education-and-outreach-programs-and-workshops/eo-undergraduate-modelling-workshop-may-21-25-2018/ (PROJECT VI - Forest Cover)

The dataset that is analyzed in the files above is one containing data on individual subjects’ demographic traits, personality traits and their use of various substances and illegal drugs. Response variables of interest that are mentioned throughout the report include:

UseLevel – binary categorical variable with levels “high” and “low” indicating drug use.

heroin_binary – binary categorical variable indicating if an individual has ever used heroin.

allelse – binary categorical variable indicating if an individual has ever used any drug in the dataset OTHER than cannabis.
